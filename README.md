-  In line with Canoe's vision of DeFi at the player's fingertips, Pikeman intends to build a consumer-driven DEX infrastructure for more players and gamers rather than a trader-driven infrastructure. 
- The Canoe team made significant contributions to the EVM and RUST Chain in the aggregator dex infra, [DODO(EVM)](https://medium.com/blog-canoe-finance/canoe-finance-integrates-dodos-aggregation-algorithm-d35a6b913cb5) and [Jupiter(Solana)](https://medium.com/blog-canoe-finance/canoe-finance-integrates-jupiters-liquidity-aggregator-1eedf665d723)
- The Canoe team delivered DeFi infra on L1s and got the grant and investment from Polygon and Rangers.
- Canoe-gaming-Defi SDK is listed on the Solana Games Kit by the Solana Foundation team. It will be the next big thing in gaming on SUI ecosystem.

## Features
### Aggregator contract

Pikeman Swap Aggregation brings to users the best price routes, best token selection in SUI ecosystem.

Our goal is to create an exchange that is fast and secure enough for high-volume trading, while also being easy enough for users who are new to cryptocurrencies or technical experts alike. **We think that this will be achieved by using state channels on Sui's network. **

Pikeman SDK aim to be the key liquidity aggregator for SUI, and provide the most powerful tools for game developers to allow them to easily access revenue-sharing swap in their application.
